    "To really have a Smart Search Engine or Virtual assistant that can answer any question about your corporate documents, this \"engine\" must understand tabular data, aka, sources with tables, rows and columns with numbers. \n",

    "We are dealing now with sources with Tables in which each row and column are related to each other, and in order to answer a question, all of the data is needed, not just top results.\n",

    "In this notebook, the goal is to show how to deal with this kind of use cases. To continue with our Covid-19 theme, we will be using an open dataset called [\"Covid Tracking Project\"](https://covidtracking.com/data/download). The COVID Tracking Project dataset is a  CSV file that provides the latest numbers on tests, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes from every US state and territory (they stopped tracking on March 7 2021).\n",

A GPT Smart Search Engine, must understand how to deal with this sources, understand the data and answer acoordingly."

    "The implementation of Agents is inspired by two papers: the [MRKL Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) paper (pronounced ‘miracle’ 😉) and the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) paper.\n",

    "Agents are a way to leverage the ability of LLMs to understand and act on prompts. In essence, an Agent is an LLM that has been given a very clever initial prompt. The prompt tells the LLM to break down the process of answering a complex query into a sequence of steps that are resolved one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents become really cool when we combine them with ‘experts’, introduced in the MRKL paper. Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself. This is actually the concept behind [ChatGPT Pluggins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, in order to solve the problem \"How do I ask questions to a tabular CSV file\", we need this REACT/MRKL approach, in which we need to instruct the LLM that it needs to use an 'expert/tool' in order to read/load/understand/interact with a CSV tabular file.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI opened the world to a whole new concept. Libraries are being created fast and furious. We will be using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) as our library to solve this problem, however there are others that we recommend: [HayStack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) and [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/whatissk)."
