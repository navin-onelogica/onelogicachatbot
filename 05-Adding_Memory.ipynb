       "\n",
       "1. **Epidemic prevention strategies**: Reinforcement learning can be used to automatically learn prevention strategies for infectious diseases. For example, a study used deep reinforcement learning to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Sparse reward tasks**: Reinforcement learning can be challenging when dealing with tasks that have sparse rewards. Self-imitation learning and exploration bonuses are two approaches that can address this challenge. A recent framework called Explore-then-Exploit (EE) interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to enhance both exploitation and exploration in learning tasks<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206262/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Personalized recommendation systems**: Reinforcement learning can be applied to personalized recommendation systems. For example, a personalized hybrid recommendation algorithm for music based on reinforcement learning was proposed. It uses techniques like weighted matrix factorization and convolutional neural networks to learn and extract song feature vectors, and it continuously updates the model based on the preferences of listeners for songs and song transitions<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206183/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Automatic feature engineering**: Feature engineering is a crucial task in machine learning projects. Reinforcement learning can be used to automate feature engineering. For example, a framework called Cross-data Automatic Feature Engineering Machine (CAFEM) formalizes the feature engineering problem as an optimization problem over a Feature Transformation Graph (FTG). It includes a feature engineering learner that learns fine-grained strategies on a single dataset and a cross-data component that speeds up feature engineering learning on unseen datasets<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206177/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\n",

       "5. **Job scheduling in data centers**: Reinforcement learning can be applied to job scheduling in data centers. For example, an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) deep reinforcement learning-based approach called A2cScheduler was proposed for job scheduling. It consists of two agents, an actor and a critic, that work together to learn the scheduling policy and reduce estimation errors.

       "1. **Epidemic Prevention**: Reinforcement learning can be used to automatically learn prevention strategies for infectious diseases. For example, a study used deep reinforcement learning to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

One approach is self-imitation learning, which encourages exploitation by imitating past good trajectories. Another approach is exploration bonuses, which enhance exploration by providing intrinsic rewards. A novel framework called Explore-then-Exploit (EE) has been introduced, which interleaves self-imitation learning with an exploration bonus to strengthen the effect of these two algorithms<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206262/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

       "3. **Personalized Recommendation Systems**: Reinforcement learning can be used to improve personalized recommendation systems.

    "We also can notice that the current chain that we are using is smart, but not that much. Although we have given memory to it, it searches for similar docs everytime, regardless of the input and it struggles to respond to prompts like: Hello, Thank you, Bye, What's your name, What's the weather and any other task that is not search in the knowledge base.\n",

    "**GPT-3.5-Turbo** can be likened to a 7-year-old child. You can provide it with concise instructions, but it frequently struggles to follow them accurately. Additionally, its limited memory can make sustained conversations challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k** resembles the same 7-year-old, but with an increased attention span for longer instructions. However, it still faces difficulties accurately executing them about half the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4** exhibits the capabilities of a 10-12-year-old child. It possesses enhanced reasoning skills and more consistently adheres to instructions. While its memory retention for instructions is moderate, it excels at following them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4-32k** is akin to the 10-12-year-old child with an extended memory. It comprehends lengthy sets of instructions and engages in meaningful conversations. Thanks to its robust memory, it offers detailed responses.\n",
